# **IPFS Wrapper - JavaScript Demo**

## **Introduction**

This demo walks through a basic integration of the IPFS wrapper in JavaScript applications.

The IPFS wrapper enables applications to interact with the IPFS protocol. This single wrapper can be used across various types of apps (web, mobile, servers) as long as the appropriate Polywrap client library is installed.

In this demo, you'll execute the `./src/index.ts` file, which creates a simple text file, and then using the Polywrap client, the file is added to IPFS and displayed in the console.

## **System Requirements**

- [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Docker Desktop
- MacOS, Windows, and Linux are supported

## **Getting Started**

Set the correct npm version:

```bash
nvm install &&
nvm use
```

Install dependencies and build:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

Set up the test environment and run the test:

> Ensure your system's Docker Daemon is running.

```bash
yarn test:env:up
yarn test
```

## **Test Results**

Upon successful execution, you'll see the following output in your console:

```bash
File Name:  hello-world.txt
File Data:  Hello World!!!

## **What Happened Explained**

### **Code Generation**

When you executed `yarn build`, the `package.json` script was triggered:

    "build": "npx polywrap codegen"

This script generated a `wrap` folder containing the IPFS wrapper's types.

With an IDE supporting intellisense, you can now view all available methods that can be called on the IPFS wrapper. âœ¨

### **Interacting with the IPFS Wrapper**

In the `./src/index.ts` file, autogenerated types are imported. The Polywrap client is instantiated and configured using the IPFS wrapper's URI:

`"ens/wraps.eth:ipfs-http-client@1.0.0"`

This URI directs the Polywrap client to locate the IPFS wrapper, which is resolved via an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain.

A text file named `hello-world.txt` is created and added to IPFS by invoking the `addFile` method on the wrapper.

Lastly, the text file is retrieved using the `cat` method, and its content is printed to the console.
